Play & Watch : Children Crossing
================================

A Game-&-Watch-like game

Context
-------

The game was programmed during the [HTML5 Game Jam 2012](http://pierreloicdoulcet.fr/HTML5GJ/) in Paris in less than
48 hours. The goal was to make a game using HTML5 that was playable with the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet. We decided to
create a Game-&-Watch-like game, using the same constraints the original Game & Watch's : colors, controls, level design,
etc.

The Game
--------

### Objectives

You play "Super Crosser", a man whose goal is to help children cross the road and get them to the school while avoiding
cars. You take the children from the bottom of the screen and release them in front of the school.
You have 3 lives before Game Over.

### How to play ?

1. Open index.html in a modern web browser that supports canvas, or in the BlackBerry Playbook.
2. On a computer, `UP` and `DOWN` arrows move the character, `V` catches and releases the child.
2b. On a tablet/smartphone, the left buttons move the character, the right button takes and releases the child.

Version history
---------------

_1.0-alpha1_ - Version showcased at the HTML5 Game Jam. We didn't win :/. Tested successfully both in Chrome and the PlayBook.
